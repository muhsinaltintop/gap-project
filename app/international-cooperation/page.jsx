    <p>This section has been developed to capture international cooperation instruments on return and readmission procedures, particularly since 2015. These include standard bilateral readmission agreements as well as non-standard return cooperation instruments and arrangements, such as deals, statements, standard operating procedures, joint ways forward on migration issues and joint declarations.</p>
    <p>Each entry includes the names of the signatories, the year of signature or type of cooperation instrument, web links to the original agreement if available. International cooperation items can be searched by entering the signing countries, relevant date or key terms. All entries can also be downloaded as a PDF/Excel document.</p>
