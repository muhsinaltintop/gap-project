    "executiveSummary": [
      <div key="1" className="mt-2">The German political context for return policy in the period 2015 to 2022 is, on the one hand, primarily characterised by continuity despite a change of government in 2021. On the other hand, it is a repetition of the migration policymaking and rhetoric of the first half of the 1990s. The persistent trend is for migration and return policymaking to be grounded in domestic factors, particularly the steady rise of right-wing populist political voices and political groups that rally against immigration. Political rhetoric portrays immigrants as burdens on the social welfare system, contributing to the prioritisation of deportation measures.</div>,
      
      <div key="2" className="mt-2">The German institutional framework for returns is highly complex due to multi-level governance with discretionary powers of the federal states and sub-national administrative actors (districts and municipalities) in the federal system. Decentralised enforcement by 16 states and their administrative bodies leads to challenges in uniform policy implementation. The Federal Ministry of the Interior plays a pivotal role in shaping return policies, with the Federal Office for Migration and Asylum (BAMF) serving as the operational entity. Return support services, such as counselling and financial assistance, exhibit variations across different federal states. Since 2015, the return governance framework has expanded to include intermediate coordination structures between the federal and state levels as well as inter-ministerial coordination at the federal level and between the state ministries of the interior. Moreover, in this multi-level governance setup, the authority and discretionary powers of judges in district and administrative courts are noteworthy, as well as of the individual &#39;decision-makers&#39; of the third-level Foreigners Authorities, who bear a special responsibility to make well-informed decisions.</div>,
      
      <div key="3" className="mt-2">Decentralised legal provisions and implementation of (supra)national requirements by multiple actors result in varying outcomes for migrants, and internal contradictions in policy execution create challenges in ensuring compliance during implementation. The influence of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) case-law significantly shapes return policies, adding layers of complexity to the legal framework. It should be acknowledged that various actors, in particular some political parties, have played an outstanding role in documenting or requesting data on returns through their parliamentary authority.</div>,
      
      <div key="4" className="mt-2">Nevertheless, there are several specific challenges in the German return regime, including those related to the legislative, institutional, and international cooperation frameworks, as well as issues in data collection, enforcement, and political communication.</div>,

    "euMember": true,
    "executiveSummary": [
  <div key="1" className="mt-2">Sweden&#39;s return and readmission policies are shaped by both national and international frameworks. The key legal instrument in Swedish migration law, including regarding matters of return, is the 2006 Aliens Act which outlines Sweden&#39;s specific procedures for returning irregular migrants and those whose asylum claims are rejected. The Aliens Act is supplemented by the 2006 Aliens Ordinance and several additional Acts and Ordinances, including the Administrative Act and the Administrative Procedures Act, as well as by EU law and international treaties and customary law in human rights and refugee law.</div>,
  
  <div key="2" className="mt-2">As also emphasized in GAPs-WP2 Sweden report, while return has been a priority at least on paper for years, its urgency has intensified in recent years. This is evident from the Swedish Migration Agency being directed by the Government to prioritise returns more than before, enhancing the efficiency of the return process and increasing the number of people actually departing Sweden. As this report outlined, there appears to be a shift in focus from voluntary to enforced returns, a development that aligns with the overall trend in Swedish migration policy towards greater restrictiveness since 2015, encapsulated by the principle &quot;no means no&quot;. This approach aims to ensure that Sweden does not deviate from the EU&#39;s minimum standards for international protection, asylum procedures, reception conditions, and return measures. The 2022 Tid√∂ Agreement&#39;s reforms further cement this stringent migration stance, reflecting what has been termed a &quot;paradigm shift&quot; in Swedish migration policy.</div>,
  
  <div key="3" className="mt-2">As an EU member state, Sweden adheres to the EU&#39;s common return policy, which emphasizes voluntary returns and reintegration in migrants&#39; home countries. It also promotes cooperation with third countries through readmission agreements. Several terms and definitions in the Return Directive or the Return Regulation<sup>1</sup> have not been transformed into the Swedish Aliens Act or other Swedish legislation. As outlined in GAPs WP2-Sweden report, while amendments and revisions to Swedish legislation have indeed been enacted to incorporate the EU Return Directive and subsequent EU legislation on return into Swedish law, the Swedish government has, on numerous points, deemed such revisions unnecessary. The government has contended that existing legislation, principally the Aliens Act, already meets or surpasses the requirements of EU law, thereby obviating the need for additional measures to align Swedish law with EU directives on these matters. This includes several definitions listed in Article 3 of the Return Directive (such as &quot;irregular stay&quot; and &quot;assisted return&quot;), and the authorised exemption from applying the Return Directive under specific conditions outlined in Articles 2.2 a and b.</div>,
  
  <div key="4" className="mt-2">The main governmental actors playing in return operations are Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) and the Police Authority (Polisen). To understand the Swedish system, it is essential to note that Swedish government agencies, including the Migration Agency and the Police Authority, are independent and largely autonomous in relation to the government. While the government has quite substantial scope for steering the operations of government agencies through annual appropriation directives and ordinances, by the appointment of top management, and through yearly monitoring and evaluations, the government has no powers to intervene in an agency&#39;s decisions in specific matters relating to the application of the law or the due exercise of its authority<sup>2</sup>. Ministerial rule is in other words not allowed in Sweden.</div>,
  
  <div key="5" className="mt-2">The regulations about regular procedures for issuing return decisions and their consequences, including re-entry bans and voluntary deportation to Sweden, are primarily established in the Aliens Act and the Act (2022:700) Concerning Special Control of Certain Aliens. The latter Act addresses aliens considered to pose threats to national security. The Migration Agency has the authority to issue expulsion or removal and deportation-related decisions (Chapter 12, Section 14 and Chapter 8, Section 17), which may be appealed to the Migration Court (Chapter 14)<sup>3</sup>. The Police Authority can also, under certain circumstances, issue such decisions (Chapter 12, Section 14 and Chapter 8, Section 17), which may be appealed to the Migration Agency or a Migration Court (Chapter 14). In addition, decisions regarding expulsion due to criminal activity fall under the jurisdiction of the court responsible for the criminal case (Aliens Act, Chapter 8a, Section 10).</div>,
  
  <div key="6" className="mt-2">The Aliens Act also defines the area of responsibility of the Police Authority concerning the enforcement of expulsion and deportation decisions. This responsibility encompasses the execution of the Police Authority&#39;s expulsion and deportation decisions and court decisions for deportation due to criminal activities (Aliens Act, Chapter 12, Section 14). Additionally, it involves enforcing a decision of expulsion and deportation if the alien, after the decision has been enforced once, is found to have returned to Sweden (Chapter 12, Section 23). The Aliens Act, Chapter 8, specifies the various grounds for expulsion and deportation, stating that an alien lacking the necessary permit to stay in Sweden should be expelled or deported, while Chapter 12 details the different aspects of enforcement of expulsion and deportation decisions. For instance, crime or suspected criminality according to the Terrorist Crimes Act (2022:666) and considerations for Sweden&#39;s security that can be found in the Act (2022:700) on Special Control of Certain Aliens are stated as grounds for expulsion in the Aliens Act (Chapter 8, Section 1, Sub-Sections 1, 2 and 3). The Security Service enforces expulsion and deportation decisions related to security cases as specified in the Aliens Act (Chapter 12, Section 14) and defined in it (Chapter 1, Section 7).</div>,
  
  <div key="7" className="mt-2">The Aliens Act outlines the circumstances under which decisions on immediate enforcement can be implemented (Chapter 8, Section 19) and provides instructions for enforcement procedures (Chapter 8, Section 20). It also details when a decision on deportation or expulsion shall be considered executed (Chapter 12, Sections 21 and 22) and when enforcement of a decision has not ceased or is still applicable (Chapter 12, Section 23).</div>,
  
  <div key="8" className="mt-2">Sweden entered into <span className="font-bold">15 bilateral readmission agreements</span> with various countries, both within and outside the EU, starting with Germany in 1956, as indicated by the schedule in an official document<sup>4</sup> provided through communication with the Migration Agency. Countries include Iraq, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, France, Kosovo, Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Switzerland, Germany, and Vietnam. Furthermore, from 2008 to 2022, Sweden has been a party to 18 EU and bilateral agreements, extending to countries such as Ukraine, T√ºrkiye, Sri Lanka, Serbia, Russia, Pakistan, Montenegro, Moldova, North Macedonia, Macao, Cape Verde, Hong Kong, Georgia, Bosnia, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Albania.</div>,

    "countryName": "Greece",
    "euMember": true,
    "executiveSummary": [
  <div key="1" className="mt-2">Greece has a long history of (formal, informal and irregular) return migration policies and practices that have taken different forms depending on the political and socioeconomic context, including forced returns, deportations, push backs, spontaneous returns, and assisted voluntary returns. Since 2015, a number of developments foregrounded specific return procedures and practices, such as the EU-T√ºrkiye Statement and the increasing number of land and sea pushbacks (as reported/evidenced especially after the events in the Greek-Turkish border region of Evros in 2020). More recently, further institutionalisation of returns can be observed with the establishment of the Directorate of Returns and Withdrawals in 2020 and the position of a National Coordinator of Returns in late 2023 within the Ministry of Migration and Asylum (MMA).</div>,
  
  <div key="2" className="mt-2">The analysis of the legal and institutional framework governing returns in Greece highlights a number of gaps in terms of legal certainty, consistency and guaranties. The legal framework is characterised by ambiguity, mainly due to preceding legal arrangements on &#39;administrative expulsion&#39; that remain in force. Particularly, Law 3907/2011 which transposed the Return Directive 2008/115/EC into the Greek legislation and determines the operation of returns, coexists with Law 3386/2005 concerning the administrative expulsions of Third Country Nationals. An additional complexity also arises as regards the multiple national, supranational and international actors involved in returns.</div>,
  
  <div key="3" className="mt-2">While the responsibility to design and implement migration policy as a whole lies with the MMA, the police authorities also have wide legal competences in return migration governance, especially in what concerns administrative expulsions, return decisions, detention and the management of the detention system. Existing legal safeguards against return, as for example those applying to minors, pregnant women, crime victims etc., are implemented under the proviso that a TCN is not considered dangerous for national security reasons, something which is again decided by the police.</div>,
  
  <div key="4" className="mt-2">As a result, a number of inconsistencies emerge, including the fact that the respective state administration is often able to bypass the procedures of the Directive and apply the deportation procedures. This is the case, for example, with expulsion decisions issued against TCNs illegally entering Greece at the borders even if the TCNs subsequently apply for international protection and obtain a permit to stay in the country; something that raises issues of compatibility with Article 2 para. (2) (a) of the Return Directive.</div>,
  
  <div key="5" className="mt-2">Furthermore, the implementation of return, in most of its forms, is usually closely linked to detention as detention is the rule rather than the exception when there is a decision for return or deportation. This becomes evident as administrative detention is used extensively, on the grounds of public order and national security reasons, in some cases solely on the grounds of illegal entry, and despite numerous reports evidencing that the existing detention conditions severely violate detainees&#39; rights and dignity.</div>,
  
  <div key="6" className="mt-2">Existing legal inconsistencies are accompanied by poor data availability on returns. Data inconsistencies exist among different data categories (e.g. between administrative procedures and actual enforcement of returns), different data sources and different terms used. These observations may partly point to shifts in systems of recording and reporting on data over the years, alongside (in)consistency between statistical and legal categories and (lack of) convergence with EU terminology.</div>,
  
  <div key="7" className="mt-2">Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration program run by IOM provides the ground for a more humane approach to return migration, even if the context in which it operates is one of coercion, as it also addresses migrants who have been issued with a return decision and even detainees. Nevertheless, it remains underfunded if compared to other types of forced removals, a choice that reveals the political priorities of the authorities in current return and ‚Äì more generally ‚Äì migration issues.</div>,

   "executiveSummary": [
  <div key="1" className="mt-2">Poland has undergone transition from emigration to immigration country in the recent years. It was followed by developments in the country&#39;s return system and Poland has very effective enforcement of return decisions (90%). The collected data show that despite extensive legal framework guaranteeing rights of foreigners regarding their returns, there were several attempts in 2015-2023 to limit these provisions. In particular, the rights of foreigners were drastically limited since 2021, which began with the humanitarian crisis on the Polish-Belarusian border.</div>,
  
  <div key="2" className="mt-2">Analysis of the legal framework of the return proceedings shows incorrect implementation of the EU return directive. The directive was implemented incompletely in 2013. Most mandatory changes to the law have been taken into account. Optional solutions improving the foreigner&#39;s situation were omitted. For example, the possibility of waiving the entry ban in the return decision. Due to changes in the Act on Foreigners, since 2023 the Border Guard is the only body that deals comprehensively with return proceedings, which raises doubts as to the correctness of decision control in appeal proceedings and independence between first- and second-instance bodies. Foreigners do not have access to free public legal aid except for regular legal help provided by organizations supporting migrants. There is a lack of effective monitoring of the return operations, with monitoring of the independent body.</div>,
  
  <div key="3" className="mt-2">Other gaps in the Poland&#39;s return system concern inter alia establishing the Border Guard as the only body conducting return obligation proceedings, both in the first and second instances, shortening the period for filing an appeal, and abolishing the suspensive effect of filing a complaint to court. There is also a lack of qualified guardians in return proceedings concerning unaccompanied minors, automated use of detention, including the detention of children and the possibility of long-term detention, as well as the failure to ensure sufficient transparency in monitoring the implementation of return decisions, in particular by preventing the Ombudsman from monitoring. Last but not least, carrying out pushbacks, which have intensified since 2021 in connection with the humanitarian crisis on the olish-Belarusian border despite numerous ECtHR judgments, considerably threatens the human rights guarantees in the country&#39;s return system.</div>,

    "executiveSummary": [
  <div key="1" className="mt-2">In the last two decades, the Netherlands has showed increased interest in migration enforcement. In this context questions of assisted and coerced return gained more significance over years, and has become a policy priority since 2018. The datafication of returns is part of this policy prioritization. Yet, researchers should be careful in reproducing these data as it is part of the legitimization of actual return policies. Considering the data, the number of third country nationals with a return order in the Netherlands vary between 15740 and 25310 in the last 10 years. According to the Dutch Authorities, roughly 2/3 of those returns that are considered &#39;proven returns&#39; (aantoonbaar vertrek) can be considered voluntary returns (zelfstandig vertrek) and 1/3 can be considered coerced returns (Ministry of Justice and Security 2023, p. 113).</div>,
  
  <div key="2" className="mt-2">The Dutch approach to assisted and voluntary returns can be seen as a &#39;carrot and stick&#39; approach (Ebrahim & Strik 2024). Those migrants who cooperate with their return processes are offered shelter and basic services, those who do not cooperate are excluded. The institutional landscape of return migration has become increasingly complex, with more and more bilateral agreements as well as more actors involved in return migration practices.</div>,

  <div key="1" className="mt-2">T√ºrkiye&#39;s approach to return migration policy involves several key elements, encompassing legal frameworks, international cooperation, and specific programmes aimed at facilitating the return of migrants to their countries of origin.</div>,
  
  <div key="2" className="mt-2">In terms of the legal framework, T√ºrkiye enforces return migration through a legal and regulatory framework aligned with national laws and international agreements. The Law on Foreigners and International Protection (LFIP) is a cornerstone, setting out the procedures and conditions for returning foreigners in T√ºrkiye who are found to be staying irregularly or may not qualify for international protection. The LFIP outlines procedures for deportation, voluntary return, and the rights and obligations of migrants and refugees within Turkish territory. This legal framework is also in alignment with international law, standards, and obligations that include adherence to principles of non-refoulement, human rights considerations, and the dignity and safety of migrants throughout the return process.</div>,
  
  <div key="3" className="mt-2">Regarding international cooperation, T√ºrkiye has entered into readmission agreements with several countries and the European Union (EU). In addition, T√ºrkiye has a bilateral agreement-like political document, the EU-T√ºrkiye Statement, which has articles related to return and readmission. T√ºrkiye also collaborates with international organisations, such as the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and the International Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD) to ensure the humane and orderly return of migrants.</div>,
  
  <div key="4" className="mt-2">Concerning specific programmes, the assisted return and reintegration programme (AVRR) with IOM and the national voluntary programme with ICMPD (N-AVRR) are important for voluntary, safe and dignified return for migrants who wish to go back to their countries of origin, often including support for reintegration efforts.</div>,
  
  <div key="5" className="mt-2">T√ºrkiye&#39;s return migration policies are shaped by a combination of domestic priorities and international cooperation, aiming to manage return migration in a way that respects the rights of migrants while meeting the country&#39;s regulatory and security needs. These policies are subject to ongoing evaluation and adaptation, reflecting changes in migration flows, international agreements, and the broader geopolitical context.</div>,
  
  <div key="6" className="mt-2">Based on T√ºrkiye&#39;s legal framework and practical applications, four types of returns are observed: pushbacks, forced returns, assisted returns and spontaneous returns. Regarding the pushbacks, the T√ºrkiye-Greece sea and land and T√ºrkiye-Bulgaria land borders are critical on the west; T√ºrkiye-Iran and T√ºrkiye-Syria land borders represent the east and south. In terms of forced returns, administrative detention for returning and deportation exists, but T√ºrkiye also has readmission agreements and similar political collaboration pacts like the EU-T√ºrkiye Statement. T√ºrkiye also has two main assisted voluntary return programmes supported by IOM and ICPMD. Finally, there are also &quot;spontaneous returns&quot;, although not highly representative, that are not supported and are based on individual decisions. The main legal framework exists for forced returns and assisted voluntary returns.</div>,

  <div key="1" className="mt-2">Given that Iraq is a point of origin, transit, and destination for migrants and
  refugees, the patterns of migration in the country are diverse. The Iraqi
  government seeks to manage return and re-admission from multiple angles,
  particularly because Iraq receives not only voluntary and forced return
  requests but must also consider rights-based approaches from the
  perspective of host countries. Iraq has taken serious steps towards
  enhancing the governance of migration return and re-admission since the
  launch of its national migration management strategy. On this basis, the
  Iraqi government has started improving its civil registration system to
  facilitate access to legal identity, which is a step towards safely and orderly
  managing migration return in a rights-based manner. While Iraq does not
  have a comprehensive law on migration and asylum, and its law is limited to
  the 1971 political asylum law, it adopts a human rights-based approach in
  dealing with migration and return issues. Iraq has signed eight out of nine
  international human rights treaties under international human rights law.</div>,
  
  <div key="2" className="mt-2">As a supporter of the Global Compact for Migration, Iraq has shown
  leadership in the area of return and re-admission, especially given its
  progress in fulfilling its commitments, including the recent establishment of
  a national referral mechanism, enhanced cooperation on re-admission, and
  improved technical capacities regarding return operations. The
  management of return and re-admission requires the involvement of a
  broad range of stakeholders at both national and international levels. Iraq
  can strengthen national coordination among actors involved in return,
  including governmental and non-governmental stakeholders, international
  actors, and civil society organizations.

      The Ministry of Refugees and Repatriation (MoRR) is the principal authority

refugee, returnee, and reintegration policies has been significantly impeded
by administrative deficiencies and operational challenges, such as the lack

    <div key="1" className="mt-2">Nigeria&#39;s approach to return and reintegration governance is characterized by a multi-layered framework that engages various actors across international, national, subnational, and civil society levels. International organisations such as IOM, ICMPD and GIZ, provide crucial support for Nigeria&#39;s return and reintegration initiatives by offering resources and expertise to enhance effectiveness of the initiatives. Key federal government agencies involved in managing the return and reintegration processes in Nigeria include the National Commission for Refugees, Migrants, and Internally Displaced Persons (NCFRMI) which is the coordinating agency, the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation (FMHAPA), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), the Federal Ministry of Justice (FMOJ), the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development (FMWASD), the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) and the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment (FMLE). These agencies collaborate to implement policies and programs that ensure the safe return and successful reintegration of migrants. 
    </div>,
    <div key="1" className="mt-2">
    At the subnational level, state governments, especially in Lagos, Edo, Delta, and Kano actively participate in return and reintegration activities. However, the return and successful reintegration of migrants varies across the states, with some states demonstrating a more proactive approach than others. Furthermore, some state agencies and civil society organizations (CSOs) form Case Management Expert Teams and Monitoring and Evaluation Teams to assess the effectiveness of reintegration programs in their respective states. This collaboration between the different state and non-state actors at various levels of engagement ensures that the reintegration needs of returnees are adequately addressed. While local partners of the European Reintegration Support Organisation (ERSO) network sometimes travel abroad to promote the benefits of Assisted Voluntary Return (AVR) to failed asylum seekers, returnees are expected to receive immediate support upon arrival, CSOs including advocacy groups, also play a vital role in supporting returnees. Their activities often overlap, thereby re-enforcing and enhancing the overall support framework. 
    </div>,
    <div key="1" className="mt-2">
    The return process of Nigerian returnees consists of four stages: Pre-departure, Arrival, Reintegration, and Monitoring and Evaluation. The reintegration stage focuses on providing psychosocial support, vocational training, and family reunification efforts while the monitoring and evaluation track the progress of returnees, ensuring sustainable reintegration. Thus, this comprehensive multi-actor framework illustrates Nigeria&#39;s commitment to facilitating effective return and reintegration processes. By leveraging the strengths of various stakeholders, Nigeria aims to create a robust support system for returnees, ensuring their successful reintegration into society and addressing the complexities of migration challenges.</div>,

  <div key="1" className="mt-2">Return migration is a critical aspect of migration dynamics. Positioned on the two main routes of irregular migration to Europe, Morocco serves as a transit point for migrants traveling through the Western Mediterranean route, linking Morocco with the Spanish mainland, the Balearic Islands, and the two occupied Moroccan enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, as well as the Western African Atlantic route connecting the coasts of West African countries to the Canary Islands. This geographical significance necessitates reinforced border control, contributing to continuous arrests and pushbacks by national authorities.</div>,
  
  <div key="2" className="mt-2">With an estimate of more than 100,000 irregular migrants living in its territory, Morocco faces significant challenges in managing migration flows, including return to countries of origin, and protecting migrants&#39; rights. Additionally, Morocco is an essential partner for the EU in migration management, particularly in combating irregular migration and border control. Cooperation between the EU and Morocco is crucial for addressing common migration challenges and promoting regional development.</div>,
  
  <div key="3" className="mt-2">Despite adopting progressive migration policies, including a &quot;New immigration policy&quot; in 2013, the National Strategy for Immigration and Asylum (SNIA), Morocco still faces internal challenges in migration, including protecting migrants&#39; rights and integrating them into Moroccan society. Bridging these gaps and developing more effective approaches to return migration requires extensive research and collaboration among Moroccan authorities, civil society, international organizations, and development partners. This collaboration is essential to develop policies and programs that meet migrants&#39; needs and advocate for dignified and safe return migration.</div>,

    The issue of migrant returns has long been present in Tunisia. In 1985, Libya expelled over 50,000 Tunisian migrant workers due to a political crisis between the two countries. However, it was in the 1990s that irregular migration gained a significant place in Tunisian-European relations and agendas. This was largely forced by the introduction of the Schengen system, including the visas System, as well as the intensification of irregular Mediterranean crossings towards Italy.
  </div>,

  <div key="2" className="mt-2">
    Since 1998, Tunisia has signed a readmission agreement with Italy to facilitate the return of its Nationals residing irregularly in this country. Many other agreements with other European countries followed. In the same year, Morocco signed similar agreements with both Italy and Spain. From that, the return and deportation of non-European nationals by EU member states have become a central and important part of the Euro-Mediterranean migration relationships.
  </div>,

  <div key="3" className="mt-2">
    The EU and its membersStates havegradually tightened their migration policies regarding Nationals from Third Countries, following the adoption of the Return Directive in 2008. The Arab uprisings, especially the Tunisian revolution and the war against Libya in 2011 and the years after, resulted to a remarkablerise in irregular migrant arrivals from Tunisia and Libya, with over 60,000 migrants reaching the Southern coasts of Italy within just a few months.
  </div>,

  <div key="4" className="mt-2">
    In the same time, Tunisia has welcomed 313,000 people who fled the war in Libya. Thanks to the support of international organizations, it has ensured a gigantic and unprecedented operation of truly voluntary repatriation, by air and sea, of 179,284 migrants to their countries of origin, in Africa (140,062) and Asia (39,222).
  </div>,

  <div key="5" className="mt-2">
    Because of these upheavals, the EU reevaluates its relations with Tunisia and Libya, leading to propose a new type of agreement with third countries, the "Mobility Partnership". Both parties signed just the political Statement of this agreement in March 2014. However, this agreement was never completely and effectively adopted due to important disagreements and conflicts between Tunisia and the EU. The UE conditions ‚Äúfacilitating visas deliverance‚Äù against accepting (by Tunisia) a larger number of Nationals readmission, andNationals from Third Countries who had irregularly entered the EU via Tunisia.
  </div>,

  <div key="6" className="mt-2">
    The evolution that has taken place at the level of the legal context hasn‚Äôt been up to the challenges. The situation of asylum seekers and refugees is characterized by precariousness in addition to an incomplete legal framework and the lack of an asylum law. The legal texts applicable to migrants are, for their part, very old and incomplete.
  </div>,

  <div key="7" className="mt-2">
    The increase in irregular departures from Tunisia, including Tunisian citizens and foreign Nationals, has intensified since 2017 and after the end of the Covid-19 pandemic. The numerical growth of these flows has strained relations betweenTunisia and the EU. This explains the growth in the number of forced returns of Tunisian migrants expelled from the Schengen area and readmitted by the Tunisian authorities: 1,345 in 2021, 2,225 in 2022 and 2,515 in 2023.
  </div>,

  <div key="8" className="mt-2">
    At the same time, the number of arrivals from Tunisia to Italy has continued to increase, from 14,685 in 2020 to 20,218 in 2021, 32,371 in 2022, and reaching 97,000 in 2023. The majority of these irregular migrants are foreigners who crossed irregularly the Tunisian land borders with Libya and Algeria. Many others entered regularly through Tunis airport but remained in Tunisia beyond the three-month tourist stay period. Finally, the interceptions of irregular migrants at sea and their disembarkation in Tunisian ports have largely contributed to increasing the number of these migrants, which is the source of growing tensions around the presence and visibility of these sub-Saharan migrants. The Tunisian state is struggling to ensure balanced management of these irregular flows.
  </div>,

  <div key="9" className="mt-2">
    The signing of the MoU by Tunisia and the EU in July 2023 was precipitated by this migration crisis. Sub-Saharan migrants in particular have faced waves of violence and deportations at the desert borders with Algeria and Libya. A new return policy has emerged in 2023-2024. Thanks to funding from Italy and the European Union, South-South returns, presented as voluntary returns of sub-Saharan migrants to their countries of origin, and operated by the IOM office in Tunisia, have already exceeded 7,000 people during the period from March 2023 to August 2024. These returns did not exceed a few hundred/year before 2023.

    "executiveSummary": [
<div key="1" className="mt-2">The legal framework that regulates the Canadian return policy has been constructed during a political context marked by security and counterterrorism concerns following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) adopted in November 2001 has been used to facilitate the arrest, detention, and removal of inadmissible foreign nationals and ineligible refugee protection claimants, notably those who would pose a security risk. However, the IRPA must also be applied in a manner consistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the international human rights instruments to which Canada is a signatory. Therefore, the Canadian institutional framework of return assigns policy and operational responsibilities to the federal government and agencies that are monitored by administrative tribunals and federal and provincial superior courts. </div>,
<div key="2" className="mt-2">This complex institutional framework creates operational gaps in terms of data sharing and case management that lead to inconsistencies in the enforcement of removal orders. Furthermore, gaps in the legal framework threaten the human rights of foreign nationals and refugee protection claimants. The latter have long been found inadmissible or ineligible on grounds of security, administratively detained for non-criminal purposes, and removed without rigorous procedural safeguards. Human rights organizations particularly criticize the administrative detention for non-criminal purposes. Since the IRPA does not set a maximum period of detention in contradiction to international human rights standards, the administrative detention of foreign nationals pending their deportation can become indefinite. The indefinite administrative detention of foreign nationals also results from the lack of cooperation of countries of origin that either refuse to issue travel documents for their citizens or take a significant amount of time to do so. To elicit the cooperation of these countries, the Canadian return policy favours capacity-building and technical assistance activities rather than the negotiation of bilateral return agreements.</div>,

      <div key="1" className="mt-2">The UK&#39;s return policy framework is characterized by a pragmatic approach rooted in its broader migration management strategies. Since the passage of the Illegal Immigration Act of 2023, return activities‚Äîwhether forced or voluntary‚Äîare governed by a combination of national legislation and bilateral agreements. This reflects a continuity in policy direction, with return measures becoming more prominent post-Brexit as part of the government&#39;s efforts to assert control over migration flows. Political discourse around returns often emphasizes national security and public order, echoing themes seen in earlier migration debates of previous governments.</div>, 
      <div key="2" className="mt-2"> Institutionally, the UK&#39;s framework for returns is centralized under the Home Office, which oversees both operational and strategic aspects. However, implementation involves coordination with host countries, particularly in monitoring voluntary returns. Programs like the Voluntary Assisted Return and Reintegration Programme (VARRP) and the Gateway Project address vulnerable groups, including unaccompanied minors and victims of trafficking. Despite the existence of comprehensive safeguards, criticisms persist regarding the human rights implications of certain return practices, such as those linked to the controversial Bibby Stockholm facility.</div>,
      <div key="3" className="mt-2">Data management presents another layer of complexity. While return data is systematically collected from multiple sources, inconsistencies between national statistics and Eurostat highlight ongoing challenges in achieving coherence. Additionally, the UK&#39;s post-crisis return efforts, notably during the Afghan withdrawal and the Ukrainian war, have revealed gaps in reintegration support, despite the availability of guides and handbooks through the Home Office.</div>,
      <div key="4" className="mt-2">Internationally, the UK maintains a cooperative stance, being a signatory to key frameworks such as the Refugee Convention and the Global Compacts on Refugees and Migration. Bilateral migration diplomacy agreements, like the now-defunct UK-Rwanda deal, underscore the government&#39;s focus on externalizing return processes, though these initiatives remain under close scrutiny by human rights organizations and UN bodies. While the UK&#39;s legal and institutional return framework is robust, it faces significant challenges. These include inconsistencies in implementation, gaps in human rights monitoring, and tensions between domestic political imperatives and international obligations.</div>,
