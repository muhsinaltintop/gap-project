    "executiveSummary": [
      <div key="1" className="mt-2">The German political context for return policy in the period 2015 to 2022 is, on the one hand, primarily characterised by continuity despite a change of government in 2021. On the other hand, it is a repetition of the migration policymaking and rhetoric of the first half of the 1990s. The persistent trend is for migration and return policymaking to be grounded in domestic factors, particularly the steady rise of right-wing populist political voices and political groups that rally against immigration. Political rhetoric portrays immigrants as burdens on the social welfare system, contributing to the prioritisation of deportation measures.</div>,
      
      <div key="2" className="mt-2">The German institutional framework for returns is highly complex due to multi-level governance with discretionary powers of the federal states and sub-national administrative actors (districts and municipalities) in the federal system. Decentralised enforcement by 16 states and their administrative bodies leads to challenges in uniform policy implementation. The Federal Ministry of the Interior plays a pivotal role in shaping return policies, with the Federal Office for Migration and Asylum (BAMF) serving as the operational entity. Return support services, such as counselling and financial assistance, exhibit variations across different federal states. Since 2015, the return governance framework has expanded to include intermediate coordination structures between the federal and state levels as well as inter-ministerial coordination at the federal level and between the state ministries of the interior. Moreover, in this multi-level governance setup, the authority and discretionary powers of judges in district and administrative courts are noteworthy, as well as of the individual &apos;decision-makers&apos; of the third-level Foreigners Authorities, who bear a special responsibility to make well-informed decisions.</div>,
      
      <div key="3" className="mt-2">Decentralised legal provisions and implementation of (supra)national requirements by multiple actors result in varying outcomes for migrants, and internal contradictions in policy execution create challenges in ensuring compliance during implementation. The influence of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) case-law significantly shapes return policies, adding layers of complexity to the legal framework. It should be acknowledged that various actors, in particular some political parties, have played an outstanding role in documenting or requesting data on returns through their parliamentary authority.</div>,
      
      <div key="4" className="mt-2">Nevertheless, there are several specific challenges in the German return regime, including those related to the legislative, institutional, and international cooperation frameworks, as well as issues in data collection, enforcement, and political communication.</div>

    "euMember": true,
    "executiveSummary": [
  <div key="1" className="mt-2">Sweden&apos;s return and readmission policies are shaped by both national and international frameworks. The key legal instrument in Swedish migration law, including regarding matters of return, is the 2006 Aliens Act which outlines Sweden&apos;s specific procedures for returning irregular migrants and those whose asylum claims are rejected. The Aliens Act is supplemented by the 2006 Aliens Ordinance and several additional Acts and Ordinances, including the Administrative Act and the Administrative Procedures Act, as well as by EU law and international treaties and customary law in human rights and refugee law.</div>,
  
  <div key="2" className="mt-2">As also emphasized in GAPs-WP2 Sweden report, while return has been a priority at least on paper for years, its urgency has intensified in recent years. This is evident from the Swedish Migration Agency being directed by the Government to prioritise returns more than before, enhancing the efficiency of the return process and increasing the number of people actually departing Sweden. As this report outlined, there appears to be a shift in focus from voluntary to enforced returns, a development that aligns with the overall trend in Swedish migration policy towards greater restrictiveness since 2015, encapsulated by the principle &quot;no means no&quot;. This approach aims to ensure that Sweden does not deviate from the EU&apos;s minimum standards for international protection, asylum procedures, reception conditions, and return measures. The 2022 Tidö Agreement&apos;s reforms further cement this stringent migration stance, reflecting what has been termed a &quot;paradigm shift&quot; in Swedish migration policy.</div>,
  
  <div key="3" className="mt-2">As an EU member state, Sweden adheres to the EU&apos;s common return policy, which emphasizes voluntary returns and reintegration in migrants&apos; home countries. It also promotes cooperation with third countries through readmission agreements. Several terms and definitions in the Return Directive or the Return Regulation<sup>1</sup> have not been transformed into the Swedish Aliens Act or other Swedish legislation. As outlined in GAPs WP2-Sweden report, while amendments and revisions to Swedish legislation have indeed been enacted to incorporate the EU Return Directive and subsequent EU legislation on return into Swedish law, the Swedish government has, on numerous points, deemed such revisions unnecessary. The government has contended that existing legislation, principally the Aliens Act, already meets or surpasses the requirements of EU law, thereby obviating the need for additional measures to align Swedish law with EU directives on these matters. This includes several definitions listed in Article 3 of the Return Directive (such as &quot;irregular stay&quot; and &quot;assisted return&quot;), and the authorised exemption from applying the Return Directive under specific conditions outlined in Articles 2.2 a and b.</div>,
  
  <div key="4" className="mt-2">The main governmental actors playing in return operations are Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) and the Police Authority (Polisen). To understand the Swedish system, it is essential to note that Swedish government agencies, including the Migration Agency and the Police Authority, are independent and largely autonomous in relation to the government. While the government has quite substantial scope for steering the operations of government agencies through annual appropriation directives and ordinances, by the appointment of top management, and through yearly monitoring and evaluations, the government has no powers to intervene in an agency&apos;s decisions in specific matters relating to the application of the law or the due exercise of its authority<sup>2</sup>. Ministerial rule is in other words not allowed in Sweden.</div>,
  
  <div key="5" className="mt-2">The regulations about regular procedures for issuing return decisions and their consequences, including re-entry bans and voluntary deportation to Sweden, are primarily established in the Aliens Act and the Act (2022:700) Concerning Special Control of Certain Aliens. The latter Act addresses aliens considered to pose threats to national security. The Migration Agency has the authority to issue expulsion or removal and deportation-related decisions (Chapter 12, Section 14 and Chapter 8, Section 17), which may be appealed to the Migration Court (Chapter 14)<sup>3</sup>. The Police Authority can also, under certain circumstances, issue such decisions (Chapter 12, Section 14 and Chapter 8, Section 17), which may be appealed to the Migration Agency or a Migration Court (Chapter 14). In addition, decisions regarding expulsion due to criminal activity fall under the jurisdiction of the court responsible for the criminal case (Aliens Act, Chapter 8a, Section 10).</div>,
  
  <div key="6" className="mt-2">The Aliens Act also defines the area of responsibility of the Police Authority concerning the enforcement of expulsion and deportation decisions. This responsibility encompasses the execution of the Police Authority&apos;s expulsion and deportation decisions and court decisions for deportation due to criminal activities (Aliens Act, Chapter 12, Section 14). Additionally, it involves enforcing a decision of expulsion and deportation if the alien, after the decision has been enforced once, is found to have returned to Sweden (Chapter 12, Section 23). The Aliens Act, Chapter 8, specifies the various grounds for expulsion and deportation, stating that an alien lacking the necessary permit to stay in Sweden should be expelled or deported, while Chapter 12 details the different aspects of enforcement of expulsion and deportation decisions. For instance, crime or suspected criminality according to the Terrorist Crimes Act (2022:666) and considerations for Sweden&apos;s security that can be found in the Act (2022:700) on Special Control of Certain Aliens are stated as grounds for expulsion in the Aliens Act (Chapter 8, Section 1, Sub-Sections 1, 2 and 3). The Security Service enforces expulsion and deportation decisions related to security cases as specified in the Aliens Act (Chapter 12, Section 14) and defined in it (Chapter 1, Section 7).</div>,
  
  <div key="7" className="mt-2">The Aliens Act outlines the circumstances under which decisions on immediate enforcement can be implemented (Chapter 8, Section 19) and provides instructions for enforcement procedures (Chapter 8, Section 20). It also details when a decision on deportation or expulsion shall be considered executed (Chapter 12, Sections 21 and 22) and when enforcement of a decision has not ceased or is still applicable (Chapter 12, Section 23).</div>,
  
  <div key="8" className="mt-2">Sweden entered into <span className="font-bold">15 bilateral readmission agreements</span> with various countries, both within and outside the EU, starting with Germany in 1956, as indicated by the schedule in an official document<sup>4</sup> provided through communication with the Migration Agency. Countries include Iraq, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, France, Kosovo, Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Switzerland, Germany, and Vietnam. Furthermore, from 2008 to 2022, Sweden has been a party to 18 EU and bilateral agreements, extending to countries such as Ukraine, Turkey, Sri Lanka, Serbia, Russia, Pakistan, Montenegro, Moldova, North Macedonia, Macao, Cape Verde, Hong Kong, Georgia, Bosnia, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Albania.</div>,

    "countryName": "Greece",
    "euMember": true,
    "executiveSummary": [
  <div key="1" className="mt-2">Greece has a long history of (formal, informal and irregular) return migration policies and practices that have taken different forms depending on the political and socioeconomic context, including forced returns, deportations, push backs, spontaneous returns, and assisted voluntary returns. Since 2015, a number of developments foregrounded specific return procedures and practices, such as the EU-Turkey Statement and the increasing number of land and sea pushbacks (as reported/evidenced especially after the events in the Greek-Turkish border region of Evros in 2020). More recently, further institutionalisation of returns can be observed with the establishment of the Directorate of Returns and Withdrawals in 2020 and the position of a National Coordinator of Returns in late 2023 within the Ministry of Migration and Asylum (MMA).</div>,
  
  <div key="2" className="mt-2">The analysis of the legal and institutional framework governing returns in Greece highlights a number of gaps in terms of legal certainty, consistency and guaranties. The legal framework is characterised by ambiguity, mainly due to preceding legal arrangements on &apos;administrative expulsion&apos; that remain in force. Particularly, Law 3907/2011 which transposed the Return Directive 2008/115/EC into the Greek legislation and determines the operation of returns, coexists with Law 3386/2005 concerning the administrative expulsions of Third Country Nationals. An additional complexity also arises as regards the multiple national, supranational and international actors involved in returns.</div>,
  
  <div key="3" className="mt-2">While the responsibility to design and implement migration policy as a whole lies with the MMA, the police authorities also have wide legal competences in return migration governance, especially in what concerns administrative expulsions, return decisions, detention and the management of the detention system. Existing legal safeguards against return, as for example those applying to minors, pregnant women, crime victims etc., are implemented under the proviso that a TCN is not considered dangerous for national security reasons, something which is again decided by the police.</div>,
  
  <div key="4" className="mt-2">As a result, a number of inconsistencies emerge, including the fact that the respective state administration is often able to bypass the procedures of the Directive and apply the deportation procedures. This is the case, for example, with expulsion decisions issued against TCNs illegally entering Greece at the borders even if the TCNs subsequently apply for international protection and obtain a permit to stay in the country; something that raises issues of compatibility with Article 2 para. (2) (a) of the Return Directive.</div>,
  
  <div key="5" className="mt-2">Furthermore, the implementation of return, in most of its forms, is usually closely linked to detention as detention is the rule rather than the exception when there is a decision for return or deportation. This becomes evident as administrative detention is used extensively, on the grounds of public order and national security reasons, in some cases solely on the grounds of illegal entry, and despite numerous reports evidencing that the existing detention conditions severely violate detainees&apos; rights and dignity.</div>,
  
  <div key="6" className="mt-2">Existing legal inconsistencies are accompanied by poor data availability on returns. Data inconsistencies exist among different data categories (e.g. between administrative procedures and actual enforcement of returns), different data sources and different terms used. These observations may partly point to shifts in systems of recording and reporting on data over the years, alongside (in)consistency between statistical and legal categories and (lack of) convergence with EU terminology.</div>,
  
  <div key="7" className="mt-2">Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration program run by IOM provides the ground for a more humane approach to return migration, even if the context in which it operates is one of coercion, as it also addresses migrants who have been issued with a return decision and even detainees. Nevertheless, it remains underfunded if compared to other types of forced removals, a choice that reveals the political priorities of the authorities in current return and – more generally – migration issues.</div>

  <div key="1" className="mt-2">This report concerns the legal, institutional, and infrastructure framework regarding the return proceedings from Poland for foreigners with an irregular status for 2015-2023. Poland has very effective enforcement of return decisions (90%). The rights of foreigners were drastically limited since 2021, which began with the humanitarian crisis on the Polish-Belarusian border.</div>,
  
  <div key="2" className="mt-2">Analysis of the legal framework of the return proceedings shows incorrect implementation of the directive. The report discusses the relationship of EU law to Polish law, Poland&apos;s compliance with EU law and the implementation of judgments of European and international tribunals. Included also is a reference to cooperation between national institutions and organizations, as well as international cooperation. The practical knowledge of the report&apos;s authors allows them to identify compliance with migrants&apos; rights.</div>,
  
  <div key="3" className="mt-2">The directive was implemented incompletely in 2013. Most mandatory changes to the law have been taken into account. Optional solutions improving the foreigner&apos;s situation were omitted. For example, the possibility of waiving the entry ban in the return decision. Due to changes in the Act on Foreigners, since 2023 the Border Guard is the only body that deals comprehensively with return proceedings, which raises doubts as to the correctness of decision control in appeal proceedings and independence between first- and second-instance bodies. Foreigners do not have access to free public legal aid except for regular legal help provided by organizations supporting migrants. There is a lack of effective monitoring of the return operations, with monitoring of the independent body.</div>,
  
  <div key="4" className="mt-2">This report notes the biggest gaps as:</div>,
  
  <ul key="5" className="mt-2 list-inside">
    <li> - improper implementation of the Return Directive through, among others, not providing procedural safeguards and access to free legal assistance;</li>
    <li> - establishing the Border Guard as the only body conducting return obligation proceedings, both in the first and second instances, shortening the period for filing an appeal, and abolishing the suspensive effect of filing a complaint to court;</li>
    <li> - lack of qualified guardians in return proceedings concerning unaccompanied minors;</li>
    <li> - carrying out pushbacks, which have intensified since 2021 in connection with the humanitarian crisis on the Polish-Belarusian border. Despite numerous ECtHR judgments, pushbacks are carried out;</li>
    <li> - automated use of detention, including the detention of children and the possibility of long-term detention;</li>
    <li> - failure to ensure sufficient transparency in monitoring the implementation of return decisions, in particular by preventing the Ombudsman from monitoring.</li>

    "executiveSummary": [
  <div key="1" className="mt-2">In the last two decades, the Netherlands has showed increased interest in migration enforcement. In this context questions of assisted and coerced return gained more significance over years, and has become a policy priority since 2018. The datafication of returns is part of this policy prioritization. Yet, researchers should be careful in reproducing these data as it is part of the legitimization of actual return policies. Considering the data, the number of third country nationals with a return order in the Netherlands vary between 15740 and 25310 in the last 10 years. According to the Dutch Authorities, roughly 2/3 of those returns that are considered &apos;proven returns&apos; (aantoonbaar vertrek) can be considered voluntary returns (zelfstandig vertrek) and 1/3 can be considered coerced returns (Ministry of Justice and Security 2023, p. 113).</div>,
  
  <div key="2" className="mt-2">The Dutch approach to assisted and voluntary returns can be seen as a &apos;carrot and stick&apos; approach (Ebrahim & Strik 2024). Those migrants who cooperate with their return processes are offered shelter and basic services, those who do not cooperate are excluded. The institutional landscape of return migration has become increasingly complex, with more and more bilateral agreements as well as more actors involved in return migration practices.</div>

    "executiveSummary": [
  <div key="1" className="mt-2">Türkiye&apos;s approach to return migration policy involves several key elements, encompassing legal frameworks, international cooperation, and specific programmes aimed at facilitating the return of migrants to their countries of origin.</div>,
  
  <div key="2" className="mt-2">In terms of the legal framework, Türkiye enforces return migration through a legal and regulatory framework aligned with national laws and international agreements. The Law on Foreigners and International Protection (LFIP) is a cornerstone, setting out the procedures and conditions for returning foreigners in Turkey who are found to be staying irregularly or may not qualify for international protection. The LFIP outlines procedures for deportation, voluntary return, and the rights and obligations of migrants and refugees within Turkish territory. This legal framework is also in alignment with international law, standards, and obligations that include adherence to principles of non-refoulement, human rights considerations, and the dignity and safety of migrants throughout the return process.</div>,
  
  <div key="3" className="mt-2">Regarding international cooperation, Türkiye has entered into readmission agreements with several countries and the European Union (EU). In addition, Türkiye has a bilateral agreement-like political document, the EU-Turkey Statement, which has articles related to return and readmission. Türkiye also collaborates with international organisations, such as the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and the International Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD) to ensure the humane and orderly return of migrants.</div>,
  
  <div key="4" className="mt-2">Concerning specific programmes, the assisted return and reintegration programme (AVRR) with IOM and the national voluntary programme with ICMPD (N-AVRR) are important for voluntary, safe and dignified return for migrants who wish to go back to their countries of origin, often including support for reintegration efforts.</div>,
  
  <div key="5" className="mt-2">Türkiye&apos;s return migration policies are shaped by a combination of domestic priorities and international cooperation, aiming to manage return migration in a way that respects the rights of migrants while meeting the country&apos;s regulatory and security needs. These policies are subject to ongoing evaluation and adaptation, reflecting changes in migration flows, international agreements, and the broader geopolitical context.</div>,
  
  <div key="6" className="mt-2">Based on Türkiye&apos;s legal framework and practical applications, four types of returns are observed: pushbacks, forced returns, assisted returns and spontaneous returns. Regarding the pushbacks, the Türkiye-Greece sea and land and Türkiye-Bulgaria land borders are critical on the west; Türkiye-Iran and Turkey-Syria land borders represent the east and south. In terms of forced returns, administrative detention for returning and deportation exists, but Türkiye also has readmission agreements and similar political collaboration pacts like the EU-Türkiye Statement. Turkey also has two main assisted voluntary return programmes supported by IOM and ICPMD. Finally, there are also &quot;spontaneous returns&quot;, although not highly representative, that are not supported and are based on individual decisions. The main legal framework exists for forced returns and assisted voluntary returns.</div>

  <div key="1" className="mt-2">The purpose of this report is to consolidate all plans, programs, and policies that Iraq possesses concerning migration, return, and asylum. The report aims to collect, organize, and document data and statistics, including relevant laws, regulations, and strategies. It also seeks to monitor the implemented orders and rulings that enhance the management of return migration and re-admission, making them easily accessible for studies on the governance of migration return, and facilitating their review and use in other research studies and reports. This may also contribute to their future development.</div>,
  
  <div key="2" className="mt-2">Given that Iraq is a point of origin, transit, and destination for migrants and refugees, the patterns of migration in the country are diverse. Consequently, the Iraqi government has had to manage return and re-admission from multiple angles, particularly because Iraq receives not only voluntary and forced return requests but must also consider rights-based approaches from the perspective of host countries.</div>,
  
  <div key="3" className="mt-2">The Iraqi research team has worked diligently in this report to assess Iraq&apos;s readiness and ongoing efforts in this area, including relevant laws and regulations, available data and statistics, national strategies, and the key actors and stakeholders at both the national and international levels involved in managing the return process and their roles.</div>,
  
  <div key="4" className="mt-2">The team utilized fieldwork, including interviews and roundtable meetings with stakeholders, and participated in seminars and conferences during the research period. Based on these efforts, the report has documented, to the extent possible, most of the data, decisions, policies, and strategies that Iraq is working on regarding migration return, migration, and asylum.</div>,
  
  <div key="5" className="mt-2">The report indicates that Iraq has taken serious steps towards enhancing the governance of migration return and re-admission since the launch of its national migration management strategy. On this basis, the Iraqi government has started improving its civil registration system to facilitate access to legal identity, which is a step towards safely and orderly managing migration return in a rights-based manner.</div>,
  
  <div key="6" className="mt-2">While Iraq does not have a comprehensive law on migration and asylum, and its law is limited to the 1971 political asylum law, it adopts a human rights-based approach in dealing with migration and return issues. Iraq has signed eight out of nine international human rights treaties under international human rights law.</div>,
  
  <div key="7" className="mt-2">As a supporter of the Global Compact for Migration, Iraq has shown leadership in the area of return and re-admission, especially given its progress in fulfilling its commitments, including the recent establishment of a national referral mechanism, enhanced cooperation on re-admission, and improved technical capacities regarding return operations.</div>,
  
  <div key="8" className="mt-2">Despite this, some challenges remain. Iraq needs to adapt and align its laws, regulations, and policies with the spirit of the 2005 Constitution and its international obligations. Notably, Iraq has yet to sign the 1948 International Convention on Migrant Workers, the 1951 Refugee Convention, and its 1967 Protocol. The management of return and re-admission requires the involvement of a broad range of stakeholders at both national and international levels. Iraq can strengthen national coordination among actors involved in return, including governmental and non-governmental stakeholders, international actors, and civil society organizations. It should also adopt a clear and transparent migration diplomacy, openly publishing bilateral or multilateral agreements, and demonstrating flexibility in information exchange regarding return operations, providing statistics on returnees, and developing a rapid referral mechanism to the newly established national referral system.</div>,
  
  <div key="9" className="mt-2">Despite the challenges in accessing information in Iraq, including the absence of a law guaranteeing access to information and the weak cooperation of official institutions in sharing information among themselves and with researchers, the Iraqi research team was able to incorporate the following materials into the return migration data repository:</div>,

  <div key="1" className="mt-2">This report presents a comprehensive analysis of Afghanistan&apos;s Return and Reintegration Policy, with a particular focus on the roles, challenges, and procedural frameworks managed by the Ministry of Refugees and Repatriation (MoRR). As the principal authority overseeing legal and policy matters related to refugees, internally displaced persons (IDPs), and returnees, the MoRR is instrumental in shaping Afghanistan&apos;s approach to these complex issues. The ministry operates within a challenging institutional environment, where despite the absence of specific national legislation dedicated to the protection of refugees and returnees, Afghanistan has demonstrated a commitment to international norms by ratifying significant global conventions, including the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol.</div>,
  
  <div key="2" className="mt-2">The report highlights the multifaceted challenges that impede the effective implementation of return and reintegration policies in Afghanistan. Administrative deficiencies, including a shortage of skilled personnel and systemic governance issues, have significantly undermined the efficacy of these initiatives. Such challenges are consistently reflected in international assessments, where Afghanistan is ranked poorly in terms of governance capacity, as evidenced by the Brookings State Weakness Index.</div>,
  
  <div key="3" className="mt-2">The return and reintegration process, as delineated in this report, is conducted in collaboration with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and involves targeted financial and social assistance programs for registered returnees from neighboring countries, particularly Iran and Pakistan. These programs include emergency financial aid, health screenings, legal assistance, and other critical social services, with specific eligibility criteria applied to ensure the aid reaches the most vulnerable populations. Additionally, the report provides a historical overview of the institutional evolution related to the management of displacement in Afghanistan, tracing the development of relevant governmental bodies from the Soviet-backed era to the present-day Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.</div>,
  
  <div key="4" className="mt-2">This report underscores the need for enhanced administrative capacity and governance reforms to address the persistent challenges faced by Afghanistan in managing the return and reintegration of displaced populations effectively. The findings and recommendations herein aim to inform policymakers and stakeholders in their ongoing efforts to align Afghanistan&apos;s policies with international humanitarian standards and improve the support mechanisms for returnees and IDPs.</div>,

  <div key="5" className="mt-2 font-bold">The disjunction between Legal Frameworks and Policy Response to Migration Challenges</div>,
  
  <div key="6" className="mt-2">Historically, Afghanistan has lacked a bona fide refugee legislation and institution to administer and manage displacement issues. Although the first mass displacement began with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979—within a year, over six million Afghans were forced to leave their homeland in search of refugee status in different countries around the world<sup>1</sup>—the Afghan government&apos;s response to tackling the displacement issues came later in the mid 1980s. Created in 1986, the Committee of Refugee Repatriation (CRR) was the first institution responsible for addressing challenges related to refugees and IDPs<sup>2</sup>. However, as the war in Afghanistan took on different shapes (i.e., civil war between 1989 and 1995; the emergence of the Taliban regime, 1996-2000; the U.S. military intervention following the attacks of September 11, 2001; and the resurgence of Taliban insurgencies from 2004 to present)<sup>3</sup>, forcing millions of people to be uprooted and vulnerable within and across the borders, multiple institutions with different capacities were tasked by the Afghan government with handling the refugee and displacement problems. To better address the humanitarian needs of a growing number of displaced people in the 1990s—due to an intensification in the civil war following the Soviet withdrawal—the CRR was expanded into a full-fledged ministry, the MoRR<sup>8</sup> (See the following table for a historic overview of the institutional bodies tasked with dealing with internal displacement).</div>,

   <div key="5" className="mt-2 font-bold">Institutional Environment of Return and Reintegration</div>,
  
   <div key="6" className="mt-2">While Afghanistan lacks specific legislation dedicated to the protection of the rights of refugees and returnees, the country has demonstrated a commitment to international norms by signing and ratifying key global agreements. These include the 1951 Refugee Convention, its 1967 Protocol, and several other significant international humanitarian conventions, such as the Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Times of War, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (UNHCR, 2019). These instruments have served as the foundational framework guiding the Afghan government&apos;s policies and interventions over the past two decades.</div>,
   
   <div key="7" className="mt-2">The government of Afghanistan acknowledges the multifaceted nature of challenges faced by returnees, recognizing that a comprehensive protection strategy is essential. This strategy necessitates not only the safeguarding of socio-economic rights but also the establishment of robust mechanisms for collaboration between national and international humanitarian agencies. To this end, the Afghan government has initiated several policy measures aimed at addressing the unique needs of returnees.</div>,
   
   <div key="8" className="mt-2">Furthermore, a series of presidential decrees have been issued to enshrine the rights of returnees in the country. Notably, Presidential Decree No. 104, which pertains to the Land Distribution for the Settlement of Eligible Returnees and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), represents a significant step toward providing tangible support for these vulnerable populations. This decree, along with other governmental initiatives, reflects Afghanistan&apos;s efforts to align its domestic policies with international humanitarian standards, despite the absence of a dedicated national legal framework for refugees and returnees.</div>,
   
   <div key="9" className="mt-2">Despite the formulation of policies, the establishment of line ministries, and the delineation of responsibilities among various stakeholders at both national and provincial levels, the effectiveness of refugee, returnee, and reintegration policies has been significantly impeded by administrative deficiencies and operational challenges, such as the lack of a highly skilled workforce. These shortcomings have resulted in a failure to adequately address the actual needs of displaced populations and returnees.</div>,
   
   <div key="10" className="mt-2 text-primary">The underperformance of these initiatives, coupled with broader indicators of weak governance, has been consistently highlighted by international assessments of state performance. For instance, the Brookings State Weakness Index has long identified Afghanistan&apos;s severe governance issues, ranking the country second to last globally due to its inadequate capacity to deliver basic social services. This persistent ranking underscores the systemic challenges faced by Afghanistan in its efforts to effectively manage and support displaced populations and returnees within its borders.<sup>4</sup></div>,
   
   <div key="11" className="mt-2 font-bold">Return and Reintegration Infrastructure: Processes and Procedures</div>,
   <div key="12" className="mt-2">Afghanistan currently lacks a comprehensive infrastructure for facilita ng return processes. To address this gap, United Na ons refugee agencies, notably UNHCR and IOM, play pivotal roles by offering substan al ins tu onal and humanitarian aid throughout the return and reintegra on process. Collabora on between UNHCR and the Ministry of Refugees and Repatria on (MoRR) has led to the iden fica on and priori za on of 20 specific areas known as Priority Areas of Return and Reintegra on (PARRS). These areas encompass various regions within Afghanistan, including Kunduz, Mazar-e Sharif, Jawzjan, Parwan, Kabul, Jalalabad, Daykundi, Herat, and Kandahar provinces.<sup>5</sup></div>,

    <div className="text-xs mt-2">Source: UNHCR: Report on Priority Areas of Return and Reintegra on 
    </div>
  </div>,
  <div key="14" className="mt-2">In collaboration with the government of Afghanistan, UNHCR provides one-time financial emergency support (250 USD/per person; 350 - 700USD/per family) and social assistance (services including essential health screening, vaccination, legal assistance, and mine risk awareness) for registered voluntary returned Afghans from Iran and Pakistan.<sup>5</sup> However, there are certain rules and regulations in place to be eligible for cash assistance. Rules and regulations for cash assistance include registration with UNHCR and host countries - in the case of Iran those who hold asylum cards - Amayesh cards, and Pakistan Afghan Registration Card. In the context of returns from Pakistan, individuals who returned before 01 January 2023 are not eligible to receive cash grants.<sup>6</sup></div>,
  <div key="15" className="mt-2 text-primary">In the context of the reintegration process, UNHCR grants one-time financial assistance in the areas of energy (800 USD cash for a solar package for returnee families), shelter (3,300 cash for shelter), and start-up businesses (800 + 1,500 USD cash for individuals as start-up business asset) for returnees who fulfil the eligibility criteria.<sup>7</sup> The eligibility criteria to receive financial support rests on surrendering and voluntarily yielding the refugee ID or asylum document.</div>,
  
  <div key="16" className="mt-2">The MoRR also registers returnees on the borders. The government provides proof of registration for returnees from Iran and Pakistan and stipulates assistance to those who are considered the most vulnerable and eligible to receive government support.</div>,
  
  <div key="17" className="mt-2 font-bold">Conclusion and Policy Recommendations</div>,
  
  <div key="18" className="mt-2">The findings from the desk reviews and field surveys highlight significant structural and procedural challenges that hinder the successful return and reintegration of Afghan returnees. The absence of comprehensive legal and policy frameworks, coupled with the Ministry of Refugee and Reintegration's limited capacity, severely undermines the ability to support returnees in securing their socioeconomic and property rights. Additionally, the selective provision of cash assistance, which reaches only a small minority of returnees, further restricts the scope and effectiveness of reintegration efforts.</div>,
  
  <div key="19" className="mt-2">The lack of access to livelihood opportunities and the absence of psycho-social support programs compound these challenges, leaving many returnees vulnerable and without the necessary resources to rebuild their lives.</div>,
  
  <div key="20" className="mt-2 font-bold">Policy Recommendations</div>,

  
  <ol key="22" className="mt-2 list-decimal" style={{ paddingLeft: '15px', listStyleType: 'decimal' }}>
    <li className="mt-2">Development of Comprehensive Legal and Policy Frameworks: The government should prioritize the development and implementation of robust legal and policy frameworks that protect the socioeconomic and property rights of returnees. These frameworks should address the diverse needs of returnees, ensuring they have access to the necessary resources to rebuild their lives.</li>
    
    <li className="mt-2">Strengthening Institutional Capacity: It is essential to enhance the capacity of the Ministry of Refugee and Reintegration, both institutionally and in terms of human resources. This can be achieved through targeted training, capacity-building programs, and international partnerships that can provide the necessary expertise and support.</li>
    
    <li className="mt-2">Expanding Financial and Social Assistance: The provision of financial and social assistance should be expanded to include a broader range of returnees, particularly those without valid refugee or asylum identification. Assistance programs should be more inclusive, ensuring that all returnees have access to the support they need to reintegrate effectively.</li>
    
    <li className="mt-2">Establishing Sustainable Livelihood Opportunities: The government should develop and implement a long-term strategy to create sustainable livelihood opportunities for returnees. This could include vocational training programs, entrepreneurship support, and job creation initiatives tailored to the specific needs and skills of returnees.</li>
    
    <li className="mt-2">Implementing Psycho-Social Support Programs: Given the high levels of trauma reported among returnees, it is crucial to establish comprehensive psycho-social support programs. These programs should be designed to address the emotional and psychological needs of returnees, facilitating their reintegration and helping them to overcome the challenges they face.</li>
    
    <li className="mt-2">Creating a Returnee Data Management System: A systematic approach to recording and analyzing the socio-demographic data of returnees is necessary. This data is vital for designing and delivering targeted programs that meet the specific needs of different groups within the returnee population.</li>
  </ol>,

  <div key="23" className="mt-2">By addressing these key areas, the government can significantly improve the return and reintegration process, ensuring that returnees are supported in rebuilding their lives and contributing positively to their communities.</div>,

    "executiveSummary": [<div key="1" className="mt-2">Nigeria&apos;s approach to return and reintegration governance is characterized by a multi-layered framework that engages various actors across international, national, subnational, and civil society levels. International organisations such as IOM, ICMPD and GIZ, provide crucial support for Nigeria&apos;s return and reintegration initiatives by offering resources and expertise to enhance effectiveness of the initiatives. Key federal government agencies involved in managing the return and reintegration processes in Nigeria include the National Commission for Refugees, Migrants, and Internally Displaced Persons (NCFRMI) which is the coordinating agency, the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Poverty Alleviation (FMHAPA), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), the Federal Ministry of Justice (FMOJ), the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development (FMWASD), the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) and the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment (FMLE). These agencies collaborate to implement policies and programs that ensure the safe return and successful reintegration of migrants. At the subnational level, state governments, especially in Lagos, Edo, Delta, and Kano actively participate in return and reintegration activities. However, the return and successful reintegration of migrants varies across the states, with some states demonstrating a more proactive approach than others. Furthermore, some state agencies and civil society organizations (CSOs) form Case Management Expert Teams and Monitoring and Evaluation Teams to assess the effectiveness of reintegration programs in their respective states. This collaboration between the different state and non-state actors at various levels of engagement ensures that the reintegration needs of returnees are adequately addressed. While local partners of the European Reintegration Support Organisation (ERSO) network sometimes travel abroad to promote the benefits of Assisted Voluntary Return (AVR) to failed asylum seekers, returnees are expected to receive immediate support upon arrival, CSOs including advocacy groups, also play a vital role in supporting returnees. Their activities often overlap, thereby re-enforcing and enhancing the overall support framework. The return process of Nigerian returnees consists of four stages: Pre-departure, Arrival, Reintegration, and Monitoring and Evaluation. The reintegration stage focuses on providing psychosocial support, vocational training, and family reunification efforts while the monitoring and evaluation track the progress of returnees, ensuring sustainable reintegration. Thus, this comprehensive multi-actor framework illustrates Nigeria&apos;s commitment to facilitating effective return and reintegration processes. By leveraging the strengths of various stakeholders, Nigeria aims to create a robust support system for returnees, ensuring their successful reintegration into society and addressing the complexities of migration challenges.</div>],

  <div key="1" className="mt-2">Return migration is a critical aspect of migration dynamics. Positioned on the two main routes of irregular migration to Europe, Morocco serves as a transit point for migrants traveling through the Western Mediterranean route, linking Morocco with the Spanish mainland, the Balearic Islands, and the two occupied Moroccan enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, as well as the Western African Atlantic route connecting the coasts of West African countries to the Canary Islands. This geographical significance necessitates reinforced border control, contributing to continuous arrests and pushbacks by national authorities.</div>,
  
  <div key="2" className="mt-2">With an estimate of more than 100,000 irregular migrants living in its territory, Morocco faces significant challenges in managing migration flows, including return to countries of origin, and protecting migrants&apos; rights. Additionally, Morocco is an essential partner for the EU in migration management, particularly in combating irregular migration and border control. Cooperation between the EU and Morocco is crucial for addressing common migration challenges and promoting regional development.</div>,
  
  <div key="3" className="mt-2">Despite adopting progressive migration policies, including a &quot;New immigration policy&quot; in 2013, the National Strategy for Immigration and Asylum (SNIA), Morocco still faces internal challenges in migration, including protecting migrants&apos; rights and integrating them into Moroccan society. Bridging these gaps and developing more effective approaches to return migration requires extensive research and collaboration among Moroccan authorities, civil society, international organizations, and development partners. This collaboration is essential to develop policies and programs that meet migrants&apos; needs and advocate for dignified and safe return migration.</div>,

The report also outlines gaps in the legal and institutional frameworks, operational infrastructure, and international cooperation that sustain the return of foreign nationals. These gaps threaten the human rights of asylum seekers and migrants, highlight the operational difficulties in tracking the status of removal orders, and reflect the lack of cooperation of some countries of origin.

      <div key="1" className="mt-2">The UK&apos;s return policy framework is characterized by a pragmatic approach rooted in its broader migration management strategies. Since the passage of the Illegal Immigration Act of 2023, return activities—whether forced or voluntary—are governed by a combination of national legislation and bilateral agreements. This reflects a continuity in policy direction, with return measures becoming more prominent post-Brexit as part of the government&apos;s efforts to assert control over migration flows. Political discourse around returns often emphasizes national security and public order, echoing themes seen in earlier migration debates of previous governments.</div>, 
      <div key="2" className="mt-2"> Institutionally, the UK&apos;s framework for returns is centralized under the Home Office, which oversees both operational and strategic aspects. However, implementation involves coordination with host countries, particularly in monitoring voluntary returns.

Despite the existence of comprehensive safeguards, criticisms persist regarding the human rights implications of certain return practices, such as those linked to the controversial Bibby Stockholm facility.</div>,
      <div key="3" className="mt-2">Data management presents another layer of complexity. While return data is systematically collected from multiple sources, inconsistencies between national statistics and Eurostat highlight ongoing challenges in achieving coherence. Additionally, the UK&apos;s post-crisis return efforts, notably during the Afghan withdrawal and the Ukrainian war, have revealed gaps in reintegration support, despite the availability of guides and handbooks through the Home Office.</div>,
      <div key="4" className="mt-2">Internationally, the UK maintains a cooperative stance, being a signatory to key frameworks such as the Refugee Convention and the Global Compacts on Refugees and Migration. Bilateral migration diplomacy agreements, like the now-defunct UK-Rwanda deal, underscore the government&apos;s focus on externalizing return processes, though these initiatives remain under close scrutiny by human rights organizations and UN bodies. While the UK&apos;s legal and institutional return framework is robust, it faces significant challenges. These include inconsistencies in implementation, gaps in human rights monitoring, and tensions between domestic political imperatives and international obligations.</div>
