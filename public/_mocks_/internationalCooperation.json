Removing the uncertainties about the duration of the waiver for work permit fees for Syrian refugees is a first step towards making it possible that employers and employees can properly calculate expenditures- if they consider joining the formal labour market of Jordan. International agencies should support the waiver until Syrian refugees can return home as a further way of engagement in sharing Jordan's burden as a host community for Syrian refugees. Once Syrians start to return in large numbers, the government of Jordan should be transparent about the future cost of work permits and provide early information before fees for work permits for Syrians will be re-introduced."

Chaotic conditions in Syria, frequent policy changes in that country and circulation of misinformation on social media have left refugees in limbo concerning when or whether to seek to return.
