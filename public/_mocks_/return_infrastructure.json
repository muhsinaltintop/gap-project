            "summary": "Overview of the EU-IOM Initiative for Nigerian Returnees: The EU-IOM Joint Initiative in Nigeria is part of a broader framework aimed at enhancing migrant protection and sustainable reintegration across 26 African countries. This initiative, supported by the EU Trust Fund, focuses on promoting orderly, safe, and responsible migration management through the development of rights-based policies and processes.    Key Components of the Initiative Enhanced Reintegration Support (ERS): The ERS project specifically targets survivors of human trafficking, providing them with essential business development knowledge and tools.  Through the Start and Improve Your Business (SIYB) training program, developed by the International Labour Organization (ILO), participants receive both technical and life skills necessary for successful reintegration.    Training and Support: The SIYB program offers personalized assistance to small-scale entrepreneurs, covering aspects such as marketing, staffing, and regulatory navigation. Recently, a training session in Ibadan, Oyo State, included 27 participants, primarily women, focusing on refining their business ideas over five days.    Financial and Business Coaching: The initiative not only provides small business grants but also extensive coaching facilitated through partnerships with local business leaders. This comprehensive support aims to empower survivors, helping them achieve financial independence while addressing the stigma and trauma associated with their experiences.    Vocational Skills Training: In a collaborative effort with the Society for the Empowerment of Young Persons (SEYP), vocational training was provided to 44 beneficiaries, focusing on skills such as hair and weave production, catering, and soap making. These sessions also included mental health support, fostering economic self-reliance and rebuilding social networks among participants.    Legal and Formal Basis: The EU-IOM Joint Initiative is grounded in international frameworks that prioritize human rights and protection for migrants. It aligns with various European Union policies on migration, as well as international agreements on human trafficking and refugee protection. The initiative's activities are legally supported through partnerships with organizations like the U.S. Department of State's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons and funding from the Government of Switzerland through the Swiss State Secretariat for Migration.    Impact and Future Directions: The initiative has successfully trained over 20,000 returnees in Nigeria, emphasizing market analysis and reintegration support. Over the next few months, the ERS project and SIYB program will continue to assist beneficiaries with business plan assessments and mentorship opportunities, reinforcing the commitment to creating sustainable livelihoods for returnees.    Overall, the EU-IOM initiative exemplifies a comprehensive approach to migration management, focusing on the protection of vulnerable individuals while promoting their reintegration into society. Despite all these fine writings on papers, the reality on the ground is different as returnees still find it difficult reintegrating into society.",

It is proposed that, as a general rule, a decision of expulsion or deportation should include a voluntary departure period. The voluntary departure period should be set at two weeks for expulsion and four weeks for deportation. If it is not possible to grant a voluntary departure period, a decision of expulsion or deportation should normally be accompanied by a re-entry ban for a maximum duration of five years. A re-entry ban should generally also be imposed on a foreign national who has been granted a voluntary departure period but has not left the country by the end of the specified period. In such cases, the re-entry ban should be set for one year. A re-entry ban may be revoked if there are specific reasons for no longer enforcing the ban.",

Furthermore, changes are proposed, among other things, to the rules on appealing against the Police Authority's decisions regarding entry bans to avoid situations where closely related matters are handled by different appellate authorities.

The prevention is operationalized often in the form of push back through following practices: forcing migrants into rubber boats or life rafts, placement of life rafts, denial of asylum procedures, push backs after arrival, physical violence and use of firearms, removal of engines or petro, ignoring distress calls, criminalization of human rights defenders, deceptive transportation, theft and destruction of property, etc.  A substantial majority of pushback incidents occurred in the Aegean Sea as per the Turkish Coast Guard Command data: Specifically, in 2020, 305 out of 312 incidents, and in 2021, 625 out of 628 incidents occurred in this area. Geographically, Izmir had the highest number of incidents in 2020 with 103, and also in 2021 with 268 incidents. Other provinces like Muğla, Aydın, Çanakkale, Balıkesir, and Antalya also recorded pushback incidents during these years, with Muğla having the second highest number of incidents in both years (83 in 2020 and 143 in 2021).    In Turkiye, we look into the situation of migrants who are survivors of pushbacks from Greece. Our geographical entry point is İzmir and Edirne observing sea and land borders with Greece and Bulgaria. We often observe multiple attempts and cycle of migration, especially among non-Syrians who are released with an letter for invitation to leave country. This cycle create informal infrastructures beyond traditional actors' involvement. In the case of pushback RMI,  we see a local economy involved by hotels, taxi drivers, local shop owners and residents of border villages/locals. Basmane area in Izmir as well as border villages are important areas. Since November 2023, government operations increased to deter irregular migration. Operation Shield took place in Basmane in Nov 2023. 1,257 law enforcement personnel involved in tracking down irregular migrants. 170 irregular migrants apprehended. Creation of mobile migration points and increased controls affect also such local RMIs. ",

Administrative detention is imposed on those who are at risk of flight or disappearance, who violate the rules of entry or exit, who use false or fraudulent documents, who do not leave the country within the time allowed for their departure without an acceptable excuse, who pose a threat to public order, public security or public health (LFIP, Art. 57).  Persons placed under administrative detention are held in removal centres. The duration of administrative detention in removal centres cannot exceed six months. However, this period may be extended for a maximum of six more months if the deportation proceedings cannot be completed due to the foreigner's non-cooperation or failure to provide correct information or documents concerning his/her country of origin (LFIP, Art. 57/3). The governorate regularly assesses the necessity for continued administrative detention on a monthly basis. If necessary, the thirty-day period is waived. Administrative detention shall be terminated immediately for foreigners whose continued detention is not deemed necessary (LFIP, Art. 57/4). The person placed under administrative detention or his or her legal representative or lawyer may appeal against the administrative detention decision to a criminal judge of peace. The application does not suspend the administrative detention. The decision of the criminal judge of peace is final. The person placed under administrative detention or his or her legal representative or lawyer may apply again to the criminal judge of peace claiming that the conditions for administrative detention have disappeared or changed (LFIP, Art. 57/6). Unaccompanied minors are not placed under administrative detention. According to the LFIP (Art. 59), in removal centres, emergency and basic health care services that cannot be paid for by the foreigner are provided free of charge; the foreigner is given access to and consultation with relatives, a notary, a legal representative and a lawyer, as well as access to telephone services; the foreigner is given access to visitors, a consular official of the country of nationality, an official of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees; the best interests of children are taken into consideration, families are accommodated in separate places; necessary measures are taken by the Ministry of National Education to ensure that children benefit from education and training; representatives of relevant non-governmental organisations with expertise in the field of migration may visit removal centres with the permission of the PMM.

However, the agreement between Türkiye and the EU is inactive and not currently being enforced for third-country nationals. In addition, the readmission arrangement, known as the EU-Türkiye Statement, was implemented on 18 March 2016 but was suspended in 2020 and is not being currently carried on. It is debatable whether this arrangement has a binding character in international law. The reason for this debate is that the arrangement was not concluded in the form of an international treaty.     \"Readmission Agreements\" are the main effective method for international cooperation process on irregular migration. These agreements have made it necessary for the countries to take measure against irregular migration and they have ensured that irregular migrants shall return to the country of origin or the latest transit country in conformity with the protection of human rights and international practices. In other words, readmission agreements ensure that irregular migrants shall return safely to the country of origin or the latest transit country with which the agreement was concluded within the framework of the terms and conditions stated in the agreement.  Türkiye has placed an importance on signing Readmission Agreements with countries of transit and destination within the scope of combating irregular migration.
